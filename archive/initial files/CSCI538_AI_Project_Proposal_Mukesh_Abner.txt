Problem Statement
Across U.S. universities, athletic departments manage more than $18 billion annually, yet most lack analytical tools to assess whether their spending produces sustainable outcomes. Existing research focuses primarily on NCAA Division I programs, leaving mid-sized and smaller institutions without evidence-based guidance. The federal Equity in Athletics Data Analysis (EADA) dataset shows that a large share of institutions report balanced or surplus budgets (efficiency ? 1.0) in publicly disclosed data. According to the NCAA’s own guidance, 'many, if not most' athletic departments report break-even results because institutional support absorbs deficits. This results in a zero-inflated distribution of efficiency ratios, complicating standard regression modeling. The central research question is: How can artificial intelligence predict athletic-department efficiency and uncover the structural and operational factors that most influence fiscal surplus?
Data and Data Collection
Data Source: U.S. Department of Education – Equity in Athletics Data Analysis (EADA) Portal (https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/).
Coverage: 2013–2023 (~17,200 institution-years from ~1,700 institutions). 
All monetary values are inflation-adjusted to 2023 USD using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The dataset contains institution-level data on revenues, expenses, athletic aid, salaries, recruiting costs, participation counts, and institutional context (Division, State, and Enrollment). 
From 2,040 institutions reported in the EADA dataset (2013–2023), only those with complete ten-year data were retained to support longitudinal modeling. Some institutions reported multiple times per year for different divisions, football status, or campuses—these were handled using the official UNITID identifier to ensure consistent tracking. The final dataset contains 1,722 unique UNITID-based institutions with full reporting across all ten years.

1. Merge annual EADA CSVs (2013–2023) by UNITID and OPE ID.
2. Clean numeric fields and apply CPI-U inflation adjustment.
3. Impute missing values (median for continuous, mode for categorical by Division).
4. Drop features with >30% missingness and verify Efficiency Ratio consistency.
5. Encode Division (one-hot), State (target encoding), Year (ordinal).
6. Normalize continuous variables (z-score normalization).
7. Use temporal holdout: Train 2013–2020, test 2021–2023.
Goal / Scope
The objective is to construct a two-stage machine learning framework that accurately predicts athletic-department efficiency while remaining interpretable. 
Stage 1 uses XGBoost for binary classification to predict whether an institution achieves surplus (Efficiency > 1.0). 
Stage 2 applies XGBoost regression to predict surplus magnitude for those institutions. 
Both models will be interpreted using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to quantify each feature’s impact on predictions. 
A case study on Texas A&M University–Commerce (TAMUC) will analyze how its NCAA Division I reclassification (2018–2020) may have influenced its efficiency trajectory between 2013–2023.
Expected Results
The Stage 1 classifier is expected to achieve target metrics in the range of ROC-AUC ? 0.78–0.83 and accuracy ? 75%, based on prior studies using XGBoost on similar institutional datasets (Chen & Guestrin, 2016; Fulks, 2015). 
The Stage 2 regressor aims for R² ? 0.70–0.75 with RMSE ? 0.12 efficiency units, in line with observed variance in financial efficiency modeling. 
These are performance targets, not empirical results, they represent expected ranges drawn from prior literature and comparable applications. Preliminary hypotheses: structural factors (Division, Total Undergraduates, Total Expenses) determine whether an institution achieves surplus, while operational factors (Spend_per_Athlete, Women_Share, Revenue_per_Athlete) influence surplus magnitude. 
The final analysis will test these expectations and replace benchmarks with actual performance metrics once modeling is complete.
