# Post-Discussion Repository: ML-EDA, Data Processing, Analysis & Visualization

## 1. Context

After our discussion with the professor, she emphasized four main aspects to focus on:

* **Machine Learning Exploratory Data Analysis (MLEDA)**
* **Data Processing**
* **Data Analysis**
* **Visualization**

This repository captures our progress since that meeting, including what has been completed, what has changed, and the next actions we need to take.

## 2. Repository Structure

### 📂 `initial_files/`

Contains the **original project proposal** and dataset submitted earlier. These serve as our baseline before doing any in-depth analysis.

### 📂 `first_EDA/`

This section documents the **first round of MLEDA** conducted on the original dataset.

* Purpose: To explore the dataset and test whether it qualifies as a machine learning problem.
* Key takeaway: There were **data gaps and limitations** that made the initial problem only partially suitable for ML.

### 📂 `revised_EDA/`

After identifying issues in the first EDA, this section reflects the **revised analysis**.

* The **problem statement** was refined.
* A **fresh EDA** was performed with a focus on data quality, target definition, and model feasibility.
* The outcome looks **more promising** and aligns better with what the professor expects.

### 📄 `Strategic Plan - Best ML Model.md`

This document summarizes **three potential ML problem directions** derived from our latest analyses.
Each proposed problem has:

* A brief explanation of why it fits ML criteria
* The expected features and target variables
* A note on data readiness and next steps

Our next task is to **review these three options and decide which one to proceed with**.

## 3. Current Status

* ✅ Completed: Initial and Revised EDA
* ✅ Identified: Gaps and limitations in the original approach
* ✅ Proposed: Three viable ML problem statements
* 🟡 Pending: Finalize one ML problem to move forward with modeling

Most of the coding support was assisted by LLMs and agents. However, every analytical step, data check, and EDA insight has been **validated manually** to ensure correctness and learning value.

## 4. Next Steps for the Team

1. **Go through the documents** in order: `initial_files → first_EDA → revised_EDA → Strategic Plan`.
2. **Evaluate** the three ML problem options in the Strategic Plan file.
3. **Choose** one to move forward with.

   * If none seem viable, we can consider **switching datasets** or **adopting a new existing ML case study** and just follow the tutorials and save time.
4. Once finalized, we’ll:

   * Begin data preprocessing
   * Build baseline ML models
   * Prepare visualization outputs for presentation

## 5. Closing Note

This repo reflects our **iterative learning process**—from exploratory work to critical reassessment. Take time to go through the EDAs carefully. It should take about 20–30 minutes to understand the flow and see why the second iteration looks stronger.

Let’s review the three proposed problems together before committing to the final model.
