Subject: Revised ML Proposal - Temporal Forecasting Approach

Professor,

Following our discussion about my NCAA EADA ML project, I've completely 
redesigned the approach. I identified the circular reasoning problem in my 
original proposal and rebuilt it as a proper temporal forecasting problem.

Key improvements:
- Redefined as forecasting (predict year t+1 using year t data)
- Created lag features to avoid circular reasoning
- Established baseline performance (85.71% persistence model)
- Identified strongest predictor (Lag1_Has_Surplus: 0.69 correlation)

The revised analysis shows this IS a valid ML problem with learnable patterns.

Attached:
1. Critical Issues document (details all problems found)
2. Revised EDA notebook (shows the fixes)

Could we schedule 15 minutes to discuss whether this approach meets your 
requirements for the project?

Thank you,
