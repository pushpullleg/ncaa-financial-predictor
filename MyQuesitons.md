4. does it solve something like I'll be able to predict what is the income or what is the trend where it will be or what kind of question is going to actually solve in real life for the purpose of the management? 
5. Fundamentally, to ask, we had accuracy of 50% and how it all became 70-80%. If you are neglecting some rows, then how did you make these changes? Isn't it like squid, only taking rows that make sense? I am not understanding. Help me to appreciate what you are doing actually. 
6. And also I need to make sure what are the dependent files installed, what are the tech stacks involved, what are the techniques involved, and why my techniques are used, and all that stuff. 



Answers to Your Questions
1. What is the purpose of the result? Provide a use case study.
Purpose: Predict which NCAA athletic departments will be on an Improving, Stable, or Declining financial trajectory over the next 1-2 years.

Use Case: An Athletic Director at a mid-sized university logs into a dashboard. The model flags their department as "Declining" with 85% confidence. The SHAP analysis shows that their Revenue-Expense Ratio has been dropping and Per-Athlete Spending is too high. They proactively cut travel costs and renegotiate vendor contracts before facing budget cuts or layoffs.

2. Why did you choose this technique? How do you know? Explain the story.
The Story:

Original approach (rejected): Predict efficiency ratio using same-year revenue/expenses → Professor rejected as circular reasoning (using expenses to predict expense-based ratio).
Revised approach: Shift to temporal forecasting — use Year t features to predict Year t+1 trajectory. This avoids circularity.
Why XGBoost + SMOTE?
XGBoost handles non-linear relationships and mixed feature types well
SMOTE addresses class imbalance (Improving class was underrepresented)
Compared 4 models (majority baseline, logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost) — XGBoost had best balance of accuracy and interpretability
3. What is the underlying question that is solving?
"Given a school's financial history, participation numbers, and structural context (division, gender allocation), will their finances IMPROVE, STAY STABLE, or DECLINE next year?"

This is a 3-class classification problem, not regression.

4. Does it solve something like predicting income or trend for management?
Yes, it solves trend prediction. Specifically:

It does NOT predict exact dollar amounts (income/expense values)
It DOES predict the direction of financial health (trajectory)
For management: "You are heading toward decline" is actionable — they can intervene early
Think of it like a financial early warning system, not a precise forecast
5. How did accuracy go from 50% to 70-80%? Did we just remove bad rows? Isn't that cheating?
Great question — this is NOT cheating. Here's what happened:

Change	Why It's Valid
Removed schools with <5 years data	You can't compute "trajectory" without enough history. This is a data requirement, not cherry-picking.
Added lag features	Using Year t-1 and Year t-2 data gives the model actual predictive signal. The original had weak features.
SMOTE for class balancing	The "Improving" class was rare (~15%). SMOTE synthetically balances training data so the model doesn't just predict "Stable" for everything.
Temporal split	Train on earlier years, test on later years — ensures we're predicting the future, not memorizing.
Bottom line: We didn't throw away inconvenient rows. We filtered to rows that have enough history to define a trajectory, then engineered features that actually carry predictive signal.

6. What are the dependencies, tech stacks, and techniques involved?
Tech Stack:

Category	Tools
Language	Python 3.13
Data	pandas, numpy
ML	scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
Interpretability	SHAP
Visualization	matplotlib, seaborn
Deployment	joblib (model serialization), CLI script
Techniques Used:

Technique	Why Used
Lag Features	Capture temporal patterns (Year t-1, t-2 values)
SMOTE	Balance underrepresented "Improving" class
One-Hot Encoding	Handle categorical variables (Division)
Stratified Train/Test Split	Maintain class proportions in both sets
XGBoost	Gradient boosting handles non-linear relationships, feature interactions
SHAP	Explain which features drive predictions (required for interpretability)
Does this clarify things? Let me know if you want me to expand on any point before we continue.
