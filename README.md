# CSCI 538 Final Submission Workspace

- `final/` – everything for the need of submission (README, report, dataset fact sheet, metrics, deployment notes, deliverable-ready artifacts).
- `archive/` – the rest of the exploratory work, notebooks, and planning documents kept for reference.

Open `final/README.md` for the concise aim / do / get / impact summary and navigation links.
